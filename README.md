# Algorithms & Problem Solving - Level 1 Solutions 

This repository contains my solutions for the **Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 1 Course**. These exercises demonstrate my understanding of logical thinking, algorithm design, and clean coding practices in C++.

## Problem Sets Overview

### 1. Set 1: Basics & Structures (Problems 1-10)
A collection of fundamental problems focusing on data handling, logical checks, and code modularity.
* **Key Problems:** Hire Driver System, Full Name Reversal, Student Marks Average.
* **Concepts:** Structs, Enums, Arrays, Input Validation, Modular Functions.
* **Status:** [✅ Completed](./01_Basics_and_Structures)

### 2. Set 2: Math Algorithms & Logic (Problems 11-20)
Focuses on advanced control flow, referencing variables, and mathematical algorithms.
* **Key Problems:** Swap Numbers (Pass by Ref), Max of 3, Complex Area Calculations.
* **Concepts:** Pass by Reference, Nested Ifs, `cmath` Library.
* **Status:** [✅ Completed](./02_Math_Algorithms_and_Logic)

### 3. Set 3: Functions & Reusability (Problems 21-30)
*Coming Soon...*
Demonstrates the power of breaking down complex logic into reusable components.
* **Concepts:** Recursive Logic, Advanced Functions, Header Files.
